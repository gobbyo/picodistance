# Electronic Distance Measure and Laser Level

Capabilities needed.

## Project Overview

This electronic distance measure and laser level uses a raspberry pi pico with an ultrasonic sensor to measure distances up to about 15 feet or 4.57 meters. The external-facing components, such as the ultrasonic sensor, switches, lasers, displays, and buttons are all inset in the casing so that you can measure from the front or back of the device from a flush surface.

Some advantages of the electronic distance measure:
- Non-contact measurement: Ultrasonic sensors can measure distance without physically touching the object. This makes them ideal for measuring distances to moving objects or to objects that are difficult to access.
- High accuracy: Ultrasonic sensors can provide highly accurate measurements with resolutions as fine as a fraction of a millimeter.
- Low cost: Ultrasonic sensors are relatively inexpensive compared to other distance-measuring technologies, such as laser range finders.
- Large measuring range: Ultrasonic sensors can typically measure distances from a few centimeters up to several meters, making them versatile in a range of applications.

Keep in mind the following limitations:
- Susceptible to interference: Ultrasonic sensors can be affected by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and air density, which can affect the speed of sound and introduce errors in measurements.
- Limited performance in certain materials: Ultrasonic sensors may not perform well on certain materials, such as soft, porous or highly absorbent surfaces, which can absorb or scatter ultrasonic waves.
- Limited angular resolution: Ultrasonic sensors can only measure distances in a straight line and are not well suited for measuring distances to objects with complex shapes or contours.
- Limited measurement rate: Ultrasonic sensors typically have a slower measurement rate compared to other technologies, such as laser sensors, which can limit their usefulness in applications requiring high-speed measurements.
